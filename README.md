# ðŸŽ’ Visual Representation of Fractional Knapsack Using Greedy Strategy

A web-based interactive mini project built for the **M.Sc. Computer Science â€“ I** (Semester - I) course . It visually demonstrates the **Fractional Knapsack Problem** using a **Greedy Algorithm**. 

---

## ðŸ§  Description

This application helps visualize the concept of maximizing value in a knapsack with limited capacity by allowing the inclusion of fractional parts of items. It uses a greedy strategy to ensure optimal results.
